# 🕵️‍♂️ CrimeCast: Forecasting Crime Categories

Welcome to **CrimeCast**, a machine learning project aimed at accurately predicting crime categories using a rich dataset of historical crime incidents. This project was developed for the [Kaggle CrimeCast Competition](https://kaggle.com/competitions/crime-cast-forecasting-crime-categories) and leverages a variety of data science techniques to turn data into actionable insights.

---

## 📊 Dataset Overview

The dataset provides detailed information on crime incidents, including:

- 📅 Date & Time of Incident  
- 📍 Location (Coordinates/Neighborhood)  
- 👤 Victim Demographics  
- ⚖️ Other Incident Attributes

The goal is to predict the **type of crime** based on these features.

## ⚙️ Project Pipeline

This project employs a comprehensive ML pipeline, including:

### 🔄 Preprocessing
- Missing value imputation (`SimpleImputer`, `KNNImputer`)
- Categorical encoding (`OneHotEncoder`, `LabelEncoder`)
- Feature scaling (`StandardScaler`, `MinMaxScaler`, `RobustScaler`, `PowerTransformer`)
- Dimensionality reduction (`PCA` with 95% variance retention)
- Handling imbalance using `SMOTE`

### 🧠 Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- AdaBoost
- Extra Trees
- Ridge Classifier
- MLP Classifier (Neural Network)
- XGBoost & LightGBM
- Voting Classifier (Ensemble of top models)

### 📈 Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
- ROC AUC
- Confusion Matrix
